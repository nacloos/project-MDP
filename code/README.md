Here is a description of the scripts:

* *snakes_and_ladders.py* provides a probability transition function for the Snakes and Ladders game, and it also provides a class to simulate the game.

* *value_iteration.py* implements the **markovDecision** function where the value iteration algorithm is used to compute the optimal strategy. It uses the probability transition function from *snakes_and_ladders.py*.

* *agents.py* contains various agent classes that can be used to play the game, e.g. RandomAgent, OptimalAgent.
* *simulation.py* simulates the interaction between an agent and the game, it is used to compute empirically the value function.
